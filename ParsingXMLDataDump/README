This example demonstrates how to use a Velocity format to parse XML data generated from an external application and extract appropriate portions of the XML data to a Cascade page.  In this example, the XML data represents curriculum data exported from an external application.  The Velocity format relies on an index block which incorporates this XML data dump (via an XML block) along with data definition content from the calling-page (which, in this case will be an individual course page in Cascade).  Based on provided ID values (set in the data definition for each Cascade course page), we will extract the corresponding data from the curriculum XML data dump.
